# Python Networking Journey 🌐🐍

This repository is a personal lab where I explore networking in Python — starting with the `socket` module and expanding into more advanced tools and protocols. It’s a mix of hands-on code, theory, and experiments with real packet-level behavior.

## 📦 Modules I’m Exploring
- `socket` – low-level TCP/UDP, file transfers, chat apps
- `selectors` – handling multiple connections
- `asyncio` – asynchronous sockets and I/O
- `ssl` – adding encryption to socket connections
- `http.server` – quick HTTP servers
- `requests` – HTTP client-side scripting
- `scapy` – packet crafting/sniffing (ethical use)
- `struct` – packing and unpacking binary data
- `subprocess` – command execution over sockets

## 🛠️ Projects Include
- File transfer over TCP/UDP
- One-to-one and multi-client chat apps
- Port scanner (mini Nmap)
- Remote shell (for educational purposes only)
- DNS query tool
- Custom protocol experiments
- Wireshark capture analysis

## 🎯 Goal
To deeply understand how networking works under the hood in Python by building tools from scratch and simulating real-world communication between machines.

## ⚠️ Note
This is strictly for **educational and ethical** hacking/networking purposes. Any misuse is not encouraged.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Wireshark
- Linux terminal
- Git + GitHub
