# 📁 Python File Transfer using Sockets (TCP)

This project demonstrates how to transfer files between a **client** and a **server** using **Python's `socket` module** over a **TCP connection**.
'''
---

## 🚀 How It Works

This system includes two Python scripts:

- `file_server.py` – waits for incoming file from a client.
- `file_client.py` – sends a file to the server.

The connection is established using **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensures:
- Reliable delivery
- Ordered data
- No data duplication

---

## 🧠 Why TCP?

TCP is ideal for file transfers because it:
- Guarantees the file is received without loss or corruption
- Automatically handles packet order and retransmission

## 🛠️ How to Run
### ⚠️ Important Note

> ✅ You **must run the server and client in separate terminals**:

- 🖥️ Open one terminal for `file_server.py`
- 🖥️ Open another terminal for `file_client.py`

Use PowerShell or Terminal on your system.

### 1️⃣ Start the Server

In PowerShell or Terminal:
bash
```python file_server.py

bash
```python file_client.py
