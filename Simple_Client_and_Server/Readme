# 📡 TCP vs UDP – Understanding the Difference

When working with computer networks, its crucial to understand the two main transport layer protocols: 
**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**. Both serve different purposes
depending on the applications needs for reliability, speed, and efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature                   | TCP                                        | UDP                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**       | Connection-oriented                        | Connectionless                            |
| **Reliability**           | Reliable – guarantees delivery and order   | Unreliable – no guarantee of delivery     |
| **Data Integrity**        | Error checking, correction, retransmission | Error checking only (no correction)       |
| **Speed**                 | Slower due to overhead                     | Faster due to minimal overhead            |
| **Ordering**              | Maintains order of packets                 | No order guarantee                        |
| **Use Case**              | Web browsing, email, file transfer         | Streaming, gaming, VoIP                   |
| **Header Size**           | 20-60 bytes                                | 8 bytes                                   |
| **Flow Control**          | Yes                                        | No                                        |
| **Congestion Control**    | Yes                                        | No                                        |

## 🔧 When to Use TCP?

Use TCP when the application requires:
- **Reliable communication**
- **Ordered delivery**
- **Guaranteed integrity**

### 📌 Examples:
- HTTP/HTTPS (Web Browsing)
- FTP (File Transfer)
- SMTP/IMAP (Email)
- SSH (Secure Shell)

---

## 🚀 When to Use UDP?

Use UDP when the application requires:
- **Speed over reliability**
- **Real-time communication**
- **Tolerates some data loss**

### 📌 Examples:
- Live video/audio streaming
- Online multiplayer gaming
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- VoIP (Voice over IP)

---

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ Use **TCP** when you need **accuracy, order, and reliability**.
- ⚡ Use **UDP** when you need **speed and low latency**, and can tolerate some loss.
