# 📡 TCP vs UDP – Understanding the Difference

When working with computer networks, it's crucial to understand the two main transport layer protocols: 
**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**. Both serve different purposes
depending on the application's needs for reliability, speed, and efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature                    | TCP                                       | UDP                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**       | Connection-oriented                        | Connectionless                            |
| **Reliability**           | Reliable – guarantees delivery and order   | Unreliable – no guarantee of delivery     |
| **Data Integrity**        | Error checking, correction, retransmission | Error checking only (no correction)       |
| **Speed**                 | Slower due to overhead                     | Faster due to minimal overhead            |
| **Ordering**              | Maintains order of packets                 | No order guarantee                        |
| **Use Case**              | Web browsing, email, file transfer         | Streaming, gaming, VoIP                   |
| **Header Size**           | 20-60 bytes                                | 8 bytes                                   |
| **Flow Control**          | Yes                                        | No                                        |
| **Congestion Control**    | Yes                                        | No                                        |

## 🔧 When to Use TCP?

- Applications where **reliability and order** matter.
- Examples:
  - HTTP/HTTPS (Web)
  - FTP (File Transfer)
  - SMTP/IMAP (Email)

## 🚀 When to Use UDP?

- Applications needing **low latency** and can tolerate loss.
- Examples:
  - Live video/audio streaming
  - Online gaming
  - DNS queries

---

## 🎯 Summary

- Use **TCP** when you need **accuracy, order, and reliability**.
- Use **UDP** when you prioritize **speed and efficiency** over guaranteed delivery.
